# Uncommon HTML Bug: Event Listener on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to adding event listeners. The issue arises when attempting to attach an event listener to an element that hasn't yet been fully parsed and rendered by the browser. 

The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the correct implementation.
